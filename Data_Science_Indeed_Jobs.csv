Warby Parker was founded in 2010 with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. By circumventing traditional channels and designing our frames in house, we're able to offer insanely high-quality eyewear at decidedly non-insane prices (i.e., from $95 with prescription lenses—a fraction of the going price!).

In the last eight years, we've grown to over 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, opened our first optical lab in upstate New York, and launched two of our own iOS apps. And for three years running, Fast Company has named us one of the world's most innovative companies.

We also hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility. This means lots of different things, like operating carbon-neutrally and distributing a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair we sell. (We're big believers that businesses can scale and be profitable while doing good in the world.)

Of course, all work and no play makes an extremely dull office, and no one likes an extremely dull office. (We sure don't.) As an employee at Warby Parker, you can look forward to company outings, guest speakers, volunteering opportunities, and other brain- (and/or taste-bud-) stimulating activities. It also doesn't hurt that our team is just great company.

About IPA
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a research and policy nonprofit that discovers and promotes effective solutions to global poverty problems. IPA brings together researchers and decision-makers to design, rigorously evaluate, and refine these solutions and their applications, ensuring that the evidence created is used to improve the lives of the world’s poor. In recent decades, trillions of dollars have been spent on programs designed to reduce global poverty, but clear evidence on which programs succeed is rare, and when evidence does exist, decision-makers often do not know about it. IPA exists to bring together leading researchers and these decision-makers to ensure that the evidence we create leads to tangible impact on the world. Since its founding in 2002, IPA has worked with over 575 leading academics to conduct over 650 evaluations in 51 countries.

76,"Data Engineer, In Our Backyards Campaign",Vera Institute of Justice,"Reducing the Use of Jails

Please note that we will be moving our headquarters to Industry City in Brooklyn, NY next year.
The Vera Institute of Justice is working to build national momentum toward reversing mass incarceration everywhere in America. It’s an ambitious goal—so we’re also building a skilled team of researchers who like big ideas and big challenges. Does that sound like you? If so, read on.
In the last decade, the geography of mass incarceration underwent a quiet, dramatic, shift. As incarceration rates in America’s biggest cities leveled out and then declined, rates in small cities and rural America continued to rise. Today, thousands of often overlooked smaller cities, towns, and rural areas have the highest rates of incarceration and, increasingly, the most outsized jails. This untold story calls for ending mass incarceration where it begins—in all of our backyards.
To spark reform, Vera’s In Our Backyards project is advancing an ambitious research and communications agenda to inform the public dialogue and guide change to justice policy and practice. Our work is driven by the realization that if we do not respond to the shifting geography of incarceration, the apparent national gains—driven by prison and jail population declines in large metropolitan areas—will be eroded by deepening problems in the small and rural communities across the country that actually comprise most of the population.
Responsibilities
The data engineer will work in close collaboration with the team to collect, manage, and analyze data relevant to the criminal justice system, to visualize the results of these analyses, and to report findings to our partners and the public. Data analysis, data management, and software development will be the primary focus.
This position will join an interdisciplinary, cross-functional team that includes data scientists, policy experts, ethnographers, and writers that span the research, policy, and communications functions at Vera.
What we need in you:
Experience assisting with research projects in an academic or professional setting. Our projects involve working with criminal justice system data to answer cutting-edge research questions. Hands-on experience with the research process and intimate familiarity with how to work on a research team are required.
Algorithmic reasoning skills. Many of the problems you will solve require devising a step-by-step procedure from a problem statement to a solution. Experience solving such problems is a must.
Proficiency in at least one programming language. Your duties will include creating or modifying code that retrieves, maintains, analyses, and visualizes data from the criminal justice system. Experience in Python, MATLAB, or R are preferred, but no language-specific experience is required.
Strength in data. Much of the work will involve collecting, cleaning, and maintaining large datasets. Experience working with and managing data are key.
Commitment to the missions of racial justice and ending mass incarceration. You need to be fluent in the language of both, and familiar with their relationship to community/public safety.
You’re self-motivated, collaborative and look for how you can help without being told. Collaboration is a Vera value – we thrive when we learn and build on each other’s ideas, and are open to giving and receiving feedback. What’s more, it’s absolutely essential for the fast-working In Our Backyards team, which is taking on big challenges, and delving into an area of reform where so much is still unknown.
Qualifications
Candidates must possess these minimum qualifications:
Demonstrated experience in dataset preparation and analysis;
Proficiency in at least one programming language;
Strong interest or experience in criminal justice and social justice for underserved populations;
Ability to work on multiple projects effectively and efficiently, both independently and collaboratively;
Excellent oral and written communication skills;
A commitment to a collegial and collaborative workplace;
An excellent candidate will have some combination of the following:
Experience with database development;
Experience developing software;
Experience with statistical analysis using Python, MATLAB, Stata, or R.


Salary: Based on experience, and including excellent benefits, Vera believes in compensating its staff members at or above market.

Please submit cover letter and resume, and if available, a link to your github portfolio.
No phone calls, please. Only applicants selected for interviews will be contacted.

We believe homeownership is valuable. Here's why: Not only has homeownership historically been one of the most reliable ways to build wealth, it also strengthens ties to community and contributes positively to overall well-being. The way the mortgage industry operates today makes it harder and harder for people to consider homeownership -- so we set out to change that. The traditional mortgage process is designed to confuse, riddled with unnecessary fees, takes too much time, and is built on a foundation of misaligned incentive structures. It's time Americans had a Better option.

A Better option is one that puts customers in control of the largest financial transaction of their lives. It's built with best-in-class technology, supported by non-commissioned staff, and offers affordable financing options that meet customers where they are.

Since 2016, we've already funded over $1B in loans, raised $75M in capital, and won the NerdWallet Best Online Mortgage Lender for Customer Service and we're just getting started.

About IPA
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a research and policy nonprofit that discovers and promotes effective solutions to global poverty problems. IPA brings together researchers and decision-makers to design, rigorously evaluate, and refine these solutions and their applications, ensuring that the evidence created is used to improve the lives of the world’s poor. In recent decades, trillions of dollars have been spent on programs designed to reduce global poverty, but clear evidence on which programs succeed is rare, and when evidence does exist, decision-makers often do not know about it. IPA exists to bring together leading researchers and these decision-makers to ensure that the evidence we create leads to tangible impact on the world. Since its founding in 2002, IPA has worked with over 575 leading academics to conduct over 650 evaluations in 51 countries. This research has informed hundreds of successful programs that now impact millions of individuals worldwide.
