We'll pull the first 1,000 job postings since the site limits the amount of jobs it will load to that number.  Let's load the libraries we'll use."

    "With the next few lines of code, we will now automatically login to linkedin.com and navigate to the jobs page, where we'll instruct Selenium to search for \"data scientist\". To do this, we'll take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",

    "The below code starts this process. You may notice a while loop added to the code. For a reason that I cannot explain, an error would be thrown saying it could not find the element for the search box. However, when I ran the code a second time without any changes, it worked. The while loop was created to keep trying until an error was no longer thrown. Linkedin's job posting page has a couple of these, thus any instance in the code where a while loop is in place is meant to handle the errors thrown. "

    "> -  We then use the Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries to gather the page source to parse the html.\n",
    "> -  Once the html is parsed, we can build a loop to extract the list of skills required for each posting while assigning a job id, the primary industry of the job, and the title of the job for the skillset.\n",
